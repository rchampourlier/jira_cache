Fetches data from JIRA and caches it in a MongoDB store.

This allows you to build applications performing complex operations on a large number of JIRA content without the JIRA's API latency.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jira_cache'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jira_cache
